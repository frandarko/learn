## Introduction to the Basic Data Structure Challenges

All programming languages contain data structures, but these can differ from one language to another. 
The following Challenges try to teach the data structures included in JavaScript and what properties they have; these can be used to build other data structures.

We will see data structures like arrays and objects.
Data structures allow you to improve the efficiency, performance, speed, and scalability of your code/programs/applications. You will learn what data structures are, why they are important, and how to code them out in JavaScript.
